# KEOfflineYoutubeVideos

A toy iOS app written in Swift for searching youtube and downloading videos

Instructions:

1. Get a youtube API key
2. Enter the key in the ViewController network method
3. Run the app

Notes:
Download progress is terrible and needs to be done properly
App architecture is terrible.  Might be better to use tab controller
